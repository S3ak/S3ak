Some would say I am a super serious, highly opinionated, skilled dev who gets the jobs done. I'm confident in my knowledge of CSS and UX design and am ready for bigger responsibilities. I have a deep passion for "delightful" user experiences. I strive to reach the levels of the Dan Ambrov, Addy Osmani and Chris Coyier's of the world. I'm an advocate of responsive design, single responsibility principles, DRY, BEM, OOCSS, atomic design, data down actions up, separation of concerns, abstractions, test-driven development, Isomorphic app development 😵. Now! I am ready to stretch my wings into the world of fluid interactive and motion design, the kind you see on Tympanus and Muzli 🔥, shout out to react-spring and WebGL. I consider myself the bridge between design and development. This is where I provide the most value, I have built a design system of reusable components, working closely with design and engineering.
